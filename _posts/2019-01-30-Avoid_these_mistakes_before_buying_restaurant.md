<p align="justify">Ever dreamt of buying a restaurant? I guess once in a lifetime every teenager dreamt of opening his own restaurant or café. Buying a restaurant is an exciting investment. But ginding the right one can be tricky sometimes. </p>

<p align="justify">In this post, we will discuss some of the mistakes that you could make and how to avoid them! Because, running a successful restaurant will mean buying the right one and avoiding any unwanted surprises!</p>
<p align="justify">
	<b>1.	Not taking the condition of the equipment into account</b>
	<p>The equipment in the restaurant’s kitchen can be expensive and pricey to fix. It’s important that you know what condition it is in before you buy the restaurant you’re looking at.</p>
	<p>Make sure you pay according to the equipment life time. If they are too old and going to be scraped within a year, then it doesn’t makes sense to invest in such restaurant.</p>
	<p>Before you sign on the dotted line, have the building and the kitchen inspected by a professional so that you don’t get any surprises when you take it over.</p>
</p>
<p align="justify">
	<b>2. Forgetting to check the lease terms </b>
	<p>Most restaurants that you buy will be leasing the premises from which they operate. You will, therefore, be taking over that lease. The location of a restaurant is a vital part of its success so this is a task that shouldn’t be taken lightly. </p>
	<p>It’s important that you know what lease you’re taking over and how this will impact your business. Every lease is different, and you will need to take your time to understand what is involved in this lease before you buy the restaurant. </p>
	<p>Identify whether you will need to be re-approved when you take over the business and what the renewal terms are. You don’t want to be denied the lease after buying a new business.</p>
</p>

<p align="justify">
	<b>3. Not checking for existing liabilities </b>
	<p>While doing your due diligence, be sure to check that there aren’t any outstanding liabilities. When you take over the restaurant, these will become your responsibility. You do not want to be hit with any health code violations or unpaid taxes.  </p>
	<p>Buying a restaurant will also mean taking on any and all its financial obligations. It’s vital that you have a clear picture of all of these before you buy any restaurant.</p>
	
</p>

<p align="justify">
	<b>4. Check Restaurant Reputation </b>
	<p>Before buying a restaurant, look out for the restaurant’s reputation in the locality. If people already had bad experience in past, then it will be hard for you to pick start. </p>
	
	
</p>

<p align="justify">
	<b>5. Professional Help </b>
	<p>If this all seems a bit overwhelming, use a professional that will able to give you a bit of guidance! Find someone with experience in the restaurant sector so that they know what to look out for when buying a restaurant! </p>
