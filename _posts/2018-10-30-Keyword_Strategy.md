<p align="justify">Keyword strategies are essential to developing winning search engine marketing campaigns. Your keyword strategy should involve selecting high-performing keywords that drive relevant traffic to your business. Choosing the right keywords for advertising can make all the difference in your campaigns, determining how well your advertisements rank on Google and other search engine platforms.</p>

<p align="justify">Here are some Keyword Strategies that we can use to take our campaigns to a higher level –</p>


<h4>Conversion Strategy</h4>



<p align="justify">Our ultimate goal is to convert the leads to final purchase. So, our first strategy is inclined to using words that will promote our target audience to purchase not just give us impression. For e.g.- suppose you are shoe making company based in Hyderabad, so there is no point in bidding for word shoe, rather than we should bid on buy shoes in Hyderabad. Thus, In this case, long-tail or more specific keywords will likely work best for you.</p>
<h4>Define Your Goal</h4>

<p align="justify">This is one of the most important question that you need to ask yourself before choosing your keywords for bidding. If you are looking for branding than you can go for generic words like shiny shoes, classy shoes etc but if you are seeking conversion than you should first analyse each keyword in terms of conversion it can bring.</p>

<h4>Choose keywords based on more than just high search traffic</h4>

<p align="justify">Depending on which strategy you’re using, branding or conversion, you should not fall into the trap of just looking at search volume when judging which keywords to use. Just because one keyword has a whole lot more searches than another doesn’t necessarily mean it will be a better performing search term. Take the time to analyze other factors that provide more granularity. Here is an example of other factors you may want to look at:

<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li>Business/landing page relevance</li>
<li>Competition</li>
<li>Specificity</li>
<li>Intent (informational, navigational, transactional)</li>
<li>Search Volume</li>
</ul>

<h4>Competition:</h4>

<p align="justify">How competitive is the term you’re going after? If too many people are pursuing your keyword, you may want to consider others that have less competition. They’re likely going to be easier to rank for and less expensive. I give a higher score to those keywords that are less competitive.</p>

<h4>Use free tools:</h4>

<p align="justify">You can use free tools available like Keywords Everywhere, which you can use to get a rough idea about search volume and CPC for similar range of words that you search on Google.</p>

<p>Thus, any business must keep these strategies in mind before bidding on keywords for their business.</p>
