<p align="justify">On May 5,1993, at the Mumbai Airport, the first aircraft of blue and sun kissed color took off. The company that reached a revenue of Rs 252 billion, providing employment to almost 16,000 people is now forced to suspend all flights on 18th April 2019 after being into operation for last 26 years. In the third quarter of 2010, Jet Airways became the largest airline in India with a passenger market share of 22.6% but what went wrong for Jet Airways?</p>

<h4><b>What forced Jet Airways from top to bankruptcy?</b></h4>

<p align="justify"><b>1. Competitive Market Segment –</b>

As I have already mentioned in my post on “Nosediving aviation industry”, India's aviation sector is fiercely competitive. Jet earlier operating in mid-income range has taken a battering from several hugely successful low-cost airlines, including IndiGo, SpiceJet and Go Air. Jet always catered to corporates and failed to recognise that low-cost carriers were attracting customers who were price sensitive.

</p>
<p align="justify"><b>2. Wrong Family Decisions –</b>

Founder Naresh Goyal ignored the advice of his professional associates on buying of Air Sahara for $500 million in cash. This one incident starts off Jet's financial troubles that lead them to this day.
</p>
<p align="justify"><b>3. Poor Management -</b>Experts put a lot of the blame on Goyal's management style. They say his decision to have a single management team, headed by himself, running all Jet's operations was a crucial mistake. Analysts say he should have had one team running the full-service carrier and another running the budget flyer. Jet lacked a concrete business model and fiddled with it often, which confused investors, (and) passengers alike.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>4. Crude Prices –</b>Fuel, the biggest cost burden for airlines - becomes more expensive when rupee falls. Soaring oil costs and the Indian rupee hitting record lows last year affected all Indian carriers. IndiGo and SpiceJet reported massive losses but analysts say their books were resilient enough to weather the quarterly losses. Jet's, however, were saddled with debts.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the future of Jet Airways and its 16,000 employees depends on SBI, which will soon invite bidders from shortlisted suitors Etihad, NIIF, TPG Capital and Indigo Partners.</p>
