Roughly 98% of the customers that visit your store or website, leave without buying anything. But there is one important aspect here. Though, they don’t buy anything but visiting online/ physical stores makes them aware about your product. Now imagine if you could pitch these already aware audience with your unique products. Or somehow you could connect to your aware customer segment.
</p>

<p align="justify">Now, that’s possible via retargeting or commonly known as “Remarketing”.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>There are ways by which you can improve Retargeting strategy-</b></p>


<li><b>Understand the buyer’s behavior- </b>Analyzing the heat maps on your website, may gave you some important finding about your customers. Suppose if most of the customers are reaching till payment page and then not placing order, so there must be some flaw in your final checkout process. Or suppose people open the product specific page and couldn’t find the proper description that they are looking for, then it will result into customer drop.</li>


<li><b>Improve Audience Targeting – </b>Retargeting doesn’t mean just to show any advertisement. It is more about showing the relevant ads. If a person is looking for a watch then showing him TV ads doesn’t makes any sense. Improving targeting allows us to be hyper-focused on what type of content we deliver, which ultimately helps to drive down costs.</li>
<li><b>Find a compelling offer – </b>If you observe various deals on multiple e-commerce websites, they experiment with multiple offers/discounts and later they analyze which kind of offer gives the maximum customer conversion. This help them to strategies discount deals during big events, like Flipkart did “Big Billion Day” on New Year’s Eve.</li>
<li><b>Utilize Dynamic Creative Ads -</b>You’ve probably experimented with dynamic product ads on Facebook, but have you tried dynamic creative ads? Dynamic creative ads are a tremendous advertising tool because they ultimately take the guessing work out of your advertising copy. You can upload multiple images or videos, headline and description variations, as well as CTA button texts – and Facebook will test and automatically optimize for the best combinations.</li>
<li><b>Watch your advertising frequency –</b> Frequency plays an important role in picking up your brand. If you annoy your customers with too much ads, then it will destroy your brand reputation. For Instance- One Perfume/Deo brand advertise too much and it turns out to be negative for its market.</li>
